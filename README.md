## Repository Structure

The `generator` folder contains Rust code which generates a JSON file and a `.d.ts` file.
The JSON has all the data and the `.d.ts` has definitions for it.

The `site` folder has the frontend Typescript code to display it.

The Github Page is actually published out of the `gh-pages` branch. (If you want to contribute to this site,
you likely don't need to worry about that branch because it's generated automatically.)
